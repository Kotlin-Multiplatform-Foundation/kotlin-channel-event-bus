## Multi-keys, multi-producers, single-consumer event bus backed by `kotlinx.coroutines.channels.Channel`s.

- A Kotlin Multiplatform library that provides a simple event bus implementation using
  `kotlinx.coroutines.channels.Channel`s.
  This is useful for UI applications where you want to send events to communicate between
  different parts / scope of your application (e.g. send results from a screen to another screen).

- This bus is thread-safe to be used by multiple threads.
  It is safe to send events from multiple threads without any synchronization.

- `ChannelEvent.Key` will be used to identify a bus for a specific type of events.
  Each bus has a `Channel` to send events to and a `Flow` to receive events from.

- The `Channel` is unbounded (`Channel.UNLIMITED` - default) or conflated `Channel.CONFLATED`.
  The `Flow` is cold and only one collector is allowed at a time.
  This make sure all events are consumed.

## Basic usage

```kotlin
// Create your event type
data class AwesomeEvent(val payload: Int) : ChannelEvent<AwesomeEvent> {
  override val key get() = Key

  companion object Key : ChannelEventKey<AwesomeEvent>(AwesomeEvent::class)
}

// Create your bus instance
val bus = ChannelEventBus()

// Send events to the bus
bus.send(AwesomeEvent(1))
bus.send(AwesomeEvent(2))
bus.send(AwesomeEvent(3))

// Receive events from the bus
bus
  .receiveAsFlow(AwesomeEvent) // or bus.receiveAsFlow(AwesomeEvent.Key) if you want to be explicit
  .collect { e: AwesomeEvent -> println(e) }
```

## Sample

- [Android Compose sample](https://github.com/hoc081098/kotlin-channel-event-bus/tree/master/sample/app):
  an Android app using Compose UI to show how to use the library.
  It has two nested navigation graphs: `Register` and `Home`.

  - In `Register`, we have 3 steps (3 screens) to allow user to input their information, step
    by
    step.
    - A `RegisterSharedViewModel` (bound to `Register` navigation graph scope) is used
      to hold the whole state of the registration process.
      It observes events from the `ChannelEventBus` and update the state accordingly.

    - Each step screen has a `ViewModel` to hold the state of the screen, and will send events to
      the `ChannelEventBus`,
      then the `RegisterSharedViewModel` will receive those events and update the state.

  - In `Home` nav graph, we have 2 screens: `Home` and `Detail`.
    - `Home` screen has a `HomeViewModel` to hold the results received from the `Detail` screen.
      Those result events are sent from the `Detail` screen to the `ChannelEventBus`,
      and the `HomeViewModel` will receive those events and update the state.

    - `Detail` screen will send events to the `ChannelEventBus` when user clicks on the button.
      The `HomeViewModel` will receive those events and update the state.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Support more targets: `wasm` (depends on supported targets by `kotlinx.coroutines`).
- [ ] More samples.
- [ ] More docs.
- [ ] More tests.
